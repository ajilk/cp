description: Analyze time and space complexity of code
---

Analyze the provided code and determine its time and space complexity.

Provide the analysis in tabular format:

| Metric | Complexity | Explanation |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| Time   | O(?)       | Brief reason |
| Space  | O(?)       | Brief reason |

Be precise about:
- Best, average, and worst case if they differ
- Auxiliary space vs total space
- Any assumptions made about input size or operations
