Solve the LeetCode problem following these requirements:

1. **Language**: Python 3 only (use type hints)
2. **Code format**: LeetCode class-based solution (no explanations unless asked)
3. **Naming**: Follow conventions in `content/docs/naming.md`
4. **Assumptions**: All necessary imports are available

**Important**: If the question is unclear, not provided, or only a problem number/name is given, immediately use web search and web fetch to find the complete problem. Do not ask for permission.

Example output format:
```python
class Solution:
    def functionName(self, param1: int, param2: List[int]) -> int:
        # code here
        pass
```
