title: Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
---

## Overview

Floyd-Warshall Algorithm finds the shortest path distances between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph. It uses dynamic programming to consider all possible intermediate vertices, building up the solution incrementally.

Works with:
- Positive and negative edge weights
- Directed and undirected graphs
- Can detect negative cycles

## Algorithm Steps

1. Initialize distance matrix with direct edge weights
2. Set diagonal to 0 (distance from vertex to itself)
3. For each intermediate vertex $k$:
   - For each pair of vertices $(i, j)$:
     - Update distance if path through $k$ is shorter: $dist[i][j] = \min(dist[i][j], dist[i][k] + dist[k][j])$

## Complexity

| Metric           | Complexity | Reason                              |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Time Complexity  | $O(V^3)$   | Three nested loops over all vertices |
| Space Complexity | $O(V^2)$   | Distance matrix storage             |

Where V = number of vertices

## Implementation

### Matrix-Based (Integer Vertices)

```python
from math import inf

def floyd_warshall(n: int, edges: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[float]]:
    """
    n: number of vertices (0 to n-1)
    edges: list of [u, v, weight]
    Returns: distance matrix where dist[i][j] = shortest path from i to j
    """
    M = [[inf] * n for _ in range(n)]

    # Distance from vertex to itself is 0
    for i in range(n):
        M[i][i] = 0

    # Initialize with direct edges
    for a, b, w in edges:
        M[a][b] = w

    # Try all intermediate vertices
    for k in range(n):
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                M[i][j] = min(M[i][j], M[i][k] + M[k][j])

    return M
```

### Dictionary-Based (String Vertices)

```python
from collections import defaultdict
from math import inf

def floyd_warshall(edges: list[tuple[str, str, float]]) -> defaultdict[str, defaultdict[str, float]]:
    """
    edges: list of (u, v, weight) tuples
    Returns: nested dict where G[i][j] = shortest path from i to j
    """
    G = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(lambda: inf))

    vertices = set()
    for a, b, w in edges:
        G[a][b] = w
        G[a][a] = 0
        G[b][b] = 0
        vertices.add(a)
        vertices.add(b)

    for k in vertices:
        for i in vertices:
            for j in vertices:
                G[i][j] = min(G[i][j], G[i][k] + G[k][j])

    return G
```

## Example

```python
# Graph with 4 vertices
n = 4
edges = [
    [0, 1, 3],
    [0, 2, 8],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [1, 3, 5],
    [2, 3, 2]
]

M = floyd_warshall(n, edges)
# M[0][3] = 6 (path: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3)
# M[0][2] = 4 (path: 0 -> 1 -> 2)
```

## Negative Cycle Detection

If $M[i][i] < 0$ after running the algorithm, the graph contains a negative cycle reachable from vertex $i$.

```python
def has_negative_cycle(M: list[list[float]]) -> bool:
    n = len(M)
    return any(M[i][i] < 0 for i in range(n))
```

## Key Points

- Solves all-pairs shortest path in $O(V^3)$ time
- Works with negative weights (unlike Dijkstra)
- Order of loops matters: $k$ must be outermost
- Use for dense graphs or small $V$ (≤400 vertices)
- For sparse graphs, run Dijkstra $V$ times instead
- Detects negative cycles: check if $M[i][i] < 0$
- DP relation: $M[i][j] = \min(M[i][j], M[i][k] + M[k][j])$
- Can track paths by storing predecessor matrix
