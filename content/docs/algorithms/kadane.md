Kadane's Algorithm is an efficient dynamic programming algorithm used to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers.

## Complexity

| Metric           | Complexity | Reason                       |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------- |
| Time Complexity  | $O(n)$     | Single pass through array    |
| Space Complexity | $O(1)$     | Only tracks current and max sum |
