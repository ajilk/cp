title: Binary Search
---

## Overview

Binary Search is an efficient search algorithm that finds a target value within a sorted array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search space in half, eliminating half of the remaining elements with each comparison.

<Callout title="Key Requirement" type="warn">
The array must be sorted for binary search to work correctly.
</Callout>

## Algorithm Steps

1. Initialize two pointers: `left` at start, `right` at end of array
2. While `left <= right`:
   - Calculate `mid` as the middle index
   - If `A[mid] == target`, return `mid`
   - If `A[mid] < target`, search right half (`left = mid + 1`)
   - If `A[mid] > target`, search left half (`right = mid - 1`)
3. If not found, return `-1`

## Complexity

| Metric           | Complexity   | Reason                          |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Time Complexity  | $O(\log n)$  | Halves search space each step   |
| Space Complexity | $O(1)$       | Only uses constant variables    |

## Implementation

```python
def bs(A: List[int], target: int) -> int:
    left, right = 0, len(A) - 1

    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2  # Avoids overflow
        if A[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        elif A[mid] > target:
            right = mid - 1
        else:
            return mid

    return -1
```

## Example

```python
A = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13]
target = 7

# Step 1: left=0, right=6, mid=3, A[3]=7 == target
# Found at index 3

result = bs(A, 7)  # Returns 3
result = bs(A, 4)  # Returns -1 (not found)
```

## Key Points

- Requires sorted array as a precondition
<Callout title="Avoid Integer Overflow" type="warn">
Use `left + (right - left) // 2` instead of `(left + right) // 2` to avoid overflow.
</Callout>
- `left <= right` includes the case where the search space is a single element
- Can be adapted for finding insertion points, first/last occurrence, or boundary conditions
