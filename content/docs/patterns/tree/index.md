title: Tree Traversal
---

Tree traversal is the process of visiting each node in a tree data structure. There are two main categories:

- **Breadth First Traversal (BFT)** - Visit nodes level by level
- **Depth First Traversal (DFT)** - Visit nodes by exploring as deep as possible before backtracking
  - Preorder: root → left → right
  - Inorder: left → root → right
  - Postorder: left → right → root
