```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, A: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        seen = {}

        for i, v in enumerate(A):
            need = target - v
            if need in seen:
                return [seen[need], i]
            seen[v] = i

        return []

| Metric           | Complexity | Reason                            |
| ---------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------- |
| Time Complexity  | $O(n)$     | Single pass through the list      |
| Space Complexity | $O(n)$     | Dictionary to store seen elements |
