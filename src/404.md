# 404: Achievement Unlocked! 🏆

Congratulations! You found a page that doesn't exist.

#### what happened?

- you typed a url wrong (it's okay, we all do it)
- you clicked a broken link (someone's getting fired)
- the page moved and forgot to leave a forwarding address
- the internet gremlins are at it again

#### your options:

1. [go home](./index.html) - the safe choice
2. press the back button - the classic move
3. close this tab and pretend it never happened - we won't judge
